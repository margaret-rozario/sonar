# Title: Sonar Dataset Model Prediction

# Description: 

This Python machine learning project predicts whether an object in the ocean is a rock or a mine using the sonar dataset. It includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model building, and evaluation steps and aims to aid in underwater surveillance and detection.

# Key features:

1. Predicts rock or mine based on sonar dataset
2. Uses machine learning algorithms for accurate predictions
3. Includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model building, and evaluation steps
4. Helps aid in underwater surveillance and detection

This project provides a valuable tool for those working in underwater surveillance and can aid in the detection of underwater mines. Its use of machine learning algorithms and comprehensive approach to data processing make it a powerful tool for accurate predictions. Contributions and feedback are always welcome.
